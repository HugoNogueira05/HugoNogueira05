# Who am I?
Hello! My name is Hugo Nogueira and I'm a computer engineering student at FEUP.
I'm a tech fanatic and a passionate programmer.
### My socials:
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugo-nogueira555)
- Email: hugonogueira055@gmail.com
## What am I doing here?
I have created several repositories that contain all the projects that I deem worthy of sharing
My main recommendations are:
- [psihelp](https://github.com/HugoNogueira05/PsiHelp)
  - Small website that I've developed using plain CSS , HTML, JS and PHP for a contest about Mental Health (My first project as well)
- [Feup Projects](https://github.com/HugoNogueira05/FEUP-Projects)
  - Main repository where I intend to add all the projects that I develop over the course of my academic journey, all these projects will have the rightfull documentation and are all available for public use unless explicitly stated otherwise, I have tried to make the code as readable as possible to help those who like me, struggled in the beginning of their coding journey!
## My main objectives with this account:
When creating this account I three main objectives in mind:
1. Having a source control tool to help transport code between devices and prevent me from ruining versions
2. Having a portfolio for eventual job applications I might send in the future
3. Helping other programmers around the world
  - This is one of my main motivations to creating the project repositories, not that my code is the best out there, but I'm sure that someone out there is facing the same problems I've already faced, just like others had before me, so I hope that with the code I've written someone can actually learn and improve
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Copying code is neither correct nor a good way to improve, instead, try understanding the code and reading documentation and then adapting it for what you need!
